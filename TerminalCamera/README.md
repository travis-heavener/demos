# TerminalCamera

Transforms live camera feed into ascii terminal. Zoom in/out (Ctrl + / Ctrl-) to increase or decrease resolution.

Note that this project uses my phone's camera (I don't have a webcam) and gets the address via the DroidCam Android app (hence the IP).

Requires `opencv-python` package, and uses the Windows API.
